-----------------FACTORY DESIGN PATTERN------------------- 

when there is superclass and multiple subclasses and we want to get object of subclasses based on input and requirement.

Then we create factory class which takes the responsibility of creating object of class based on input.

---------Advantages ----------

	1. Focus on creating object for interface rather han implementation
	2. Loose coupling, more robust code
